# Project - Shop (Structural and Objected Oriented Programming)
Project made for the course Structural and Object Oriented Programming (laboratory) at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology (Politechnika Wroclawska)

Our main goal was to implement an advanced GUI programme using strategy pattern

Our shop simulates an average shop. That means that you can:
1. Register/log in
2. View items
3. Buy items
4. Choose way of delivery 
5. Choose way of payment
6. See transaction info
